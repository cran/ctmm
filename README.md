ctmm: Continuous-Time Movement Modeling
=======================================

ctmm is an R package for analyzing animal tracking data as a continuous-time stochastic processes. Package features include FFT variogram and Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis, Kalman-filter maximum-likelihood estimation, Kriging, simulation, and autocorrelated kernel-density home-range estimation. First-time users can start with [the Methods in Ecology and Evolution paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12559/abstract) and then move on to the up-to-date vignettes `vignette('variogram')` and `vignette('akde')`.
