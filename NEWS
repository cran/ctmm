  New function SpatialPoints.telemetry returns SpatialPoints object from telemetry data

  New function SpatialPolygonsDataFrame.akde returns akde home-range contour SpatialPolygons objects from akde object

  New function writeShapefile.akde writes akde home-range contours to ESRI shapefile

  New function raster.akde returns akde pdf raster object

  New function summary.akde returns HR area of AKDE

  Fixed bad CI in plot.telemetry model option

  as.telemetry now takes a timezone argument for as.POSIXct and defaults to UTC

  Vignettes "variogram" and "akde"

  New function as.telemetry imports MoveBank formatted csv data and returns telemetry objects

  New function variogram.zoom plots a variogram with zoom slider

  variogram.fit and variogram.zoom default to a logarithmic-scale zoom slider, which requires much less fiddling

  plot.variogram now takes multiple variogram, model, and color options

  plot.telemetry now takes multiple data, model, akde, and color options

  plot.telemetry can now make probability density plots for both Gaussian model and akde data

  ctmm.fit no longer screws up results with initial sigma guesstimates. ML parameter estimates now match closely with published Mathematica results. CIs are improved.

  ks-package was producing incorrect home-range contours and has been replaced with custom code. ML home ranges now match published Mathematica results. CIs should be improved.
