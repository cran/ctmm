PRIORITY
* UTM import (Pati's collars: x,y,zone)
* expose cex, lty, ... in plot.variogram
* combine two telemetry objects for same animal but different device (dyadic UEREs)
* compass speed plot -- or cycle argument for speeds()
* ctmm.fit -> id.parameters : force.error argument for when error is estimated to be 0
* error vignette - check back on variogram
* Telonics HDOP conversion factor (2.5)
* reference Guillaume's paper at the beginning of the periodogram vignette
* occurrence() on the same grid

OVERLAP
* overlap needs to return DOFs in an overlap object - and then define a summary function for the overlap object
* overlaps' correlated errors

ERROR PAPER
* how does error change variogram DOF calculation?
* errors on x,y,z variograms
* errors on periodograms?
* exact 4x4 matrix inverse relations in PDsolve()
* UERE error propagation from calibration (do not use as prior!)
* email ARGOS about McClintock formula
* kGcluster with tpeqd projection suggestion
* predict can return VAR.xy for isotropic with UERE<4
* propagation of error uncertainty

PROJECTION
* check projection same for plot.telemetry
* projection() <- on all plottable objects + plot option
* project()<- ignores simulated/predicted velocities & covariances without headings & magnitudes
* error as.telemetry if user attempts lon-lat projection
* check latlon projection stop code against KT's input
* document projection projection<- dispatch methods

PARALLELIZATION
* parallelize akde.list & document overlap
* overlap() man example akde() first
* simulate nsim>1 with plapply
* parallel derivatives with upper/lower/etc.

MISC WORK
* should standardization be moved to ctmm.select?
* writeRaster, ... with lists of ctmm objects (when appropriate)
* when ctmm.fit estimates error==0 exactly, the uncertainty isn't propagated because error==FALSE
* simulate with emulate=TRUE
* significant digits function (MLE+CI) for summary functions
* akde/occurrence grid=UD/raster
* p-value test for trend terms using variance of mu_alt-mu_null
* significant digits argument to summary()
* functionalize detrend & retrend in simulate/predict
* predict.ctmm cov
* spline velocity mean function
* variogram discrepancy rank function
* color array -> spatial segregation
* plot axes=c('x','y') by default or axes=c('t','z')
* catch optimizer failure (last best) in global variable and finish optimize() with warning
* specify grid partially/totally in akde/occurrence
* pre-standardize length data in ctmm.fit & ctmm.loglike (if not already) - ctmm.prepare?
* times can be pre-standardized according to tau_velocity as well?
* opacity option for plot
* predict isotropic VAR.xy output
* SpatialPolygonsDataFrame.ctmm
* writeShapefile.ctmm
* define print.ctmm and see if that works
* simulate prior=FALSE
* remove mean from kalman smoother - detrend, then add back
* change all sapply to vapply
* make sure terms of kalman filter are sorted by |magnitude|
* resort all arrays to put time in last index
* FAQ entry on automated time format reading in as.telemetry breaking with R update
* non-range resident in vignette
* default labels not working for UD contours
* occurrence error option
* boundry warning in help(ctmm.fit)
* standardize x,y prior to likelihood calculation
* plot3D of 2D UD
* ltraj export
* export ellipse drawing function
* effective DOF for diffusion rate?

PERIODIC
* calculate explicit time link for periodicity? or estimate frequency?
* DOF[mean] should just be the stationary mean
* variogram on mean detrended data with CTMM argument
* simulate.telemetry (not pure ctmm)
* smoother (non-uniform u(t) and velocity vector)
* akde... slow exact and fast approximation or block toeplitz matrix (stationary Laplace approximation?)
* plot ctmm (fall back on kde code)
* vignette: periodogram, ctmm.select

VIGNETTES & EXAMPLES
* explain effective sample sizes (DOF of summary)

OPTIMIZER
* split-parameter optimization (for periodic parameters like angle) with funnelling error target
* convex perimeter tracker
* Somehow optimizer can stop on stage 1 without proceeding to stage 2
* Stop on encapsulated
* local tangent transformation on periodic variables
* STAGE 4 - pattern search
* try to fit Gamba with error
* mc.optimize cross curvature if queue allows space
* mc.optimize fill up queue with higher-order derivatives if further space allows
* mc.genD cross correlations are wrong

pregridder composite dimension?

LOW HANGING FRUIT & Nagging issues
* add acf of calibration residuals to uere diagnostic
* sort.ctmm by IC argument
* simulate conditionally with t=t returns data and t times. predict does not. (lots of low-level changes here)
* move object coordinate x1,x2 lat-lon
* Bayesian=FALSE argument for simulate() leveraging emulate()
* project(telemetry) <- function
* check IID AICc formula for isotropic case
* change default gap skip in occurrence?
* rbind on telemetry objects
* grid fix regression - weight to coarse scale when appropriate
* detrend mean in correlogram function
* plot errors with HDOP & error model in CTMM
* rainbow.telemetry
