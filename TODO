PERIODIC 0.4.0
* test simulation fits of circulation isotropic=T/F, pREML
* variogram on mean detrended data with CTMM argument
* simulate.telemetry (not pure ctmm)
* smoother (velocity vector--check)
* akde... slow exact and fast approximation or block toeplitz matrix (stationary Laplace approximation?)
* plot ctmm (fall back on kde code)
* vignette: periodogram, ctmm.select

pREML PAPER
* document pREML
* autocorrelated AICc

ERROR PAPER
* ctmm.select for error
* standardize x,y prior to likelihood calculation
* prior on error from calibration?

VELOCITY PAPER
* predict -> velocity
* as.telemetry <- velocity
* ctmm.fit <- velocity

VIGNETTES & EXAMPLES
* explain effective sample sizes (DOF of summary)

OPTIMIZER
* Somehow optimizer can stop on stage 1 without proceeding to stage 2
* Stop on encapsulated
* local tangent transformation on periodic variables
* STAGE 4 - pattern search
* try to fit Gamba with error
* mc.optimize cross curvature if queue allows space
* mc.optimize fill up queue with higher-order derivatives if further space allows
* mc.genD cross correlations are wrong

Aligned Krige UDs
pregridder composite dimension?

LOW HANGING FRUIT & Nagging issues
* project(telemetry) <- function
* check IID AICc formula for isotropic case
* change default gap skip in occurrence?
* rbind on telemetry objects
* as.telemetry drop=TRUE/FALSE for single individuals
* grid fix regression - weight to coarse scale when appropriate
* detrend mean in correlogram function
* plot errors with HDOP & error model in CTMM
* rainbow.telemetry
* summary.telemetry.list like Dong's
* plot telemetry/UD with reverse axes (preserve x&y orientation)s
* give writeShapefile a default folder name, maybe also separate layers into different files
* compass plot
* unit Environment on plots for points()
* individualized projections
* 1-point azimuthal equidistant projection quick option
* overload covm * / to apply to area & matrix
* plot.telemetry with HDOP & UERE
* str.ctmm, str.telemetry (show, print too?)
* don't delete mean off of IOU and BM... need that to Krige I think...
* IOU with drift not setup correctly
* points methods units environment
* UERE priors from calibration
* store fixed error in data
* have summary return a warning on occurrence distributions
* variogram.list <- mean-lapply-variogram
* occurrence.list
  + need to choose/enforce the same time steps?
  + weight by period of data?
* mean.UD on occurrence objects; +1 DOF
* simulate.UD
* Bayesian simulate.ctmm models (not data)
* krige velocities, activity plot
* put overlap in vignette after publication
* predict plot with transparency proportional to uncertainty (Google Earth?)
* mean.ctmm: list -> iid

generalize Gaussian area?

More efficient sampler/smoother:
store propagator results for all time-lags
store forecast/concurrent estimates
call vectorized RNG

Include telemetry errors in unconditional simulation?
krige -> predict
