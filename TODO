ctmm model comparison functions: equivalent (to within uncertainty), similar, ...
step down on existence test
ctmm model project or stepup function
ctmm.select recycle=TRUE default for going down and up in parameters
k-selection automation, debias needed for large k
periodic ctmm.select

periodic ctmm.guess, variogram.fit

periodic simulate.telemetry

generalize Gaussian area?
homerange(method=normal)
periodic plot.ctmm
periodic akde

DOF[k,k']?

don't delete mean off of IOU and BM... need that to Krige I think
IOU with drift not setup correctly

model option vignette

UERE estimator

overlap estimator for two models/UDs

AKDE debias: variance = SVF + bandwidth

residual acf versus data acf with correct confidence intervals for no autocorrelation null hypothesis

multi-scale variogram bias correction

Fixed period parameters during fitting?

IID, OU, OUF, (an)isotropic table in vignette

general conversion function for CTMM, data, SVF?

optional columns with NAs are being discarded
or maybe report if NAs are discarded?

plot.telemetry (with error) opacity tuner or bug fix

More efficient sampler/smoother: 
store propagator results for all time-lags
store forecast/concurrent estimates
call vectorized RNG

Lapack GE solve -> Lapack PO/SY solve.

as.telemetry option: minimal columns, maximum columns, specified columns to keep

Make class representation fully S3 instead of a mixture of S3 & S4

Include telemetry errors in unconditional simulation?
krige -> predict
