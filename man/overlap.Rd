\title{Calculate the overlap between two stationary distributions}

\description{This function calculates a useful measure of similarity between distributions known as the \emph{Bhattacharyya coefficient} in statistics and simply the \emph{fidelity} or \emph{overlap} in quantum and statistical mechanics. It is roughly speaking the ratio of the intersection area to the average individual area, but it is a direct comparison between the density functions and does not require an arbitrary quantile to be specified. When applied to \code{ctmm} objects, this function returns the overlap of the two Gaussian distributions. When applied to aligned \code{UD} objects with corresponding movement models, this function returns the overlap of their (autocorrelated) kernel density estimates.}

\usage{ overlap(object,level=0.95,debias=TRUE,...) }
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{object}{A \code{list} of \code{ctmm} fit or aligned \code{UD} objects to compare.}
%  \item{CTMM}{A \code{list} of \code{ctmm} fit objects corresponding to \code{object} \code{telemetry} list.}
  \item{level}{The confidence level desired for the output.}
  \item{debias}{Approximate debiasing of the overlap.}
  \item{...}{Additional arguments relevant for \code{\link{akde}}, such as \code{res} and \code{weights}.}
}

%\details{}

\value{A table of confidence intervals on the overlap estimate. A value of \code{1} implies that the two distributions are identical, while a value of \code{0} implies that the two distributions share no area in common. Corresponding \code{ctmm} objects are necessary to provide confidence intervals and debiasing for the point esitmates.}

\note{In \code{ctmm} v0.5.2, direct support for \code{telemetry} objects was dropped and the \code{CTMM} argument was depreciated for \code{UD} objects, simplifying usage.

Uncertainties in the model fits are propagated into the overlap estimate under the approximation that the Bhattacharyya distance is a chi-square random variable. Debiasing makes further approximations noted in Winner & Noonan et al (2018).}
