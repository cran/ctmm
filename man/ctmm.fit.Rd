\title{
Specify, fit, and select continuous-time movement models
}
\description{These functions allow one to propose hypothethical movement models (with initial estimates), fit those models to the data, and select among those models via an information criteria.
The fitting functions wrap around \code{optim} and \code{ctmm.loglike} to maximize the likelihood function of continuous-time movement models described in Fleming et al (2014) and Fleming et al (2015), given 2D animal tracking data.

\details{
Model fitting and selection first requires a prototype model with guesstimated parameters (i.e., Brownian motion with a particular diffusion rate).
The initial \code{ctmm} parameter guess can be generated by the output of \code{ctmm.guess}, \code{variogram.fit} or manually specified with the function \code{ctmm(...)}, where the argument \code{tau} is explained below and additonal model options described in \code{vignette("ctmm")}.

By default, \code{tau} is an ordered array of autocorrelation timescales. 
If \code{length(tau)==0}, then an IID bi-variate Gaussian model is fit to the data.
If \code{length(tau)==1}, then an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model (Brownian motion restricted to a finite home range) is fit the data, where \code{tau} is the position autocorrelation timescale. \code{tau=Inf} then yields Brownian motion (BM).
If \code{length(tau)==2}, then the OUF model (continuous-velocity motion restricted to a finite home range) is fit to the data, where \code{tau[1]} is again the position autocorrelation timescale and \code{tau[2]} is the velocity autocorrelation timescale. \code{tau[1]=Inf} then yields integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (IOU) motion, which is a spatially unrestricted continuous-velocity process.

Model selection in \code{ctmm.select} proceeds by first fitting the initial model guess, and then attempting to simplify the autocorrelation model and complexify the deterministic (mean) model until the information criteria fails to improve. The intent of working in these directions is to avoid fitting trends to autocorrelation.
Note that simpler models in a nested hierarchy will only be attempted if they appear credible, which can be adjusted with the \code{level} argument. \code{level=1} will, therefore, always attempt a simpler model.
}

\value{
The function \code{ctmm} returns a prototype \code{ctmm} movement-model object.
By default, \code{ctmm.loglike} returns the log-likelihood of the model \code{CTMM}.
\code{ctmm.fit} (and \code{ctmm.loglike} with \code{verbose=TRUE}) returns the maximum likelihood \code{ctmm} movement-model object with all of the components of \code{CTMM} plus the components listed below.
\code{ctmm.select} returns the best model by default or the list of attempted models if \code{verbose=TRUE}.
\describe{
\item{\code{AICc}}{The corrected Akaike information criterion, under the assumption of a linear model. Not all model parameters here are linear, but the linear AICc is still implemented rather than AIC because AICc is known to behave well for analogous discrete-time models. Also, following the arguments of Burnham & Anderson (2002), AICc should be an improvement over AIC here because the model parameters are not extremely nonlinear, etc..}
\item{\code{loglike}}{The log-likelihood.}
\item{\code{sigma}}{The maximum likelihood variance/covariance estimate (possibly debiased). For the endlessly diffusing BM and IOU processes, this is instead the diffusion rate estimate.}
\item{\code{mu}}{The maximum likelihood stationary mean vector estimate.}
\item{\code{COV.mu}}{The covariance matrix of the vector \code{mu}, assuming that the point estimate \code{sigma} is good.}
\item{\code{DOF.mu}}{The effective number of degrees of freedom in the estimate of \code{mu}, assuming that the point estimate of \code{tau} is good. This can be much smaller than \code{length(data$t)} if the data are autocorrelated.}
\item{\code{COV}}{Covariance of the parameter vector \code{c(sigma,tau,circle)}, as derived from \code{hessian}, and where \code{sigma} is parameterized in terms of its standard \code{area}, \code{eccentricity}, and \code{angle} of orientation. Typically, \code{sigma}'s \code{area} parameter is extremely correlated to \code{tau[1]}, and sequential components of \code{tau} are slightly correlated.}

\note{
Fitting without telemetry errors involves fewer parameters and is much faster than fitting with telemetry errors, as the variance/covariance can be profiled analytically without numerical optimization.
Therefore, fitting without telemetry errors, if possible, can provide improved initial estimates of \code{tau} and \code{sigma} for later fitting with telemetry errors.

The default \code{\link{optim}} method here is \code{"Nelder-Mead"} with the largest allowable number of maximum iterations. Annecdotally, the faster \code{"BFGS"} and \code{"L-BFGS-B"} methods often perform poorly on these types of problems.

The AICs of endlessly diffusing models like BM and IOU cannot be easily compared to the AICs of range resident models like bivariate Gaussian, OU, and OUF. Endlessly diffusing models have to be conditioned off of an initial state, which we derive in \code{ctmm} by taking the large range limit of a range-restricted process. I.e., BM is the limit OU(\code{Inf}) and IOU(\code{tau}) is the limit OUF(\code{Inf},\code{tau}). Using comparable likelihood functions would give up statistical efficiency and the objective prior.

Prior to v0.3.2, \code{ctmm.select} would consider every possible model.
This is no longer feasible with current versions of \code{ctmm}, as the number of possible models has grown too large.
